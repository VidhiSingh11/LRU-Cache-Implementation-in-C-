# LRU-Cache-Implementation-in-C-
A simple and efficient Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache written in C++ using:  std::list → Doubly linked list for tracking usage order  std::unordered_map → Direct access to nodes in O(1) time  This project simulates a browser history cache with fixed capacity. When the cache is full, the least recently used entry is automatically removed.
